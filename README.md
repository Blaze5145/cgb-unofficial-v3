Information to all developers and testers:

*There'll be four main branches
1)source-update (Untouched CGB)
2)master (Stable)
3)Beta (Testers' branch)
4)Alpha (Developers' + Advanced Testers' branch)
*All bugfixes and feature additions will be done on seperate branches for each fix/mod. Upon completion they'll be merged into the Alpha branch.
*Upon receiving evidence that the mod/fix works for the most of the testers of the people without any issues it'll be merged into the Beta branch.
*Once the bugfix/mod works for ALL of the testers it'll be merged into the stable branch.
*What the above means is that ALL bugfixes and mods should be merged into the Alpha branch first for preliminary testing. So developers please create pull requests into Alpha NOT the master branch.
